### 1) Web UI over Tailscale: reachability + auth + device pairing
We verified that exposing the Dashboard through Tailscale is a three-part requirement:
- routing (Tailscale Serve / reverse proxy to localhost)
- gateway token-based auth
- device pairing for WebSocket access

Once pairing was approved for the relevant devices, the UI became usable end-to-end.

### 2) BrightData skill: make it resilient, not fragile
We focused on improving the BrightData integration so it behaves well without constant manual configuration. The key direction was reducing setup friction (e.g., auto-discovery patterns) and ensuring stable JSON output for research/scraping workflows.

### 3) Moltbook exploration: useful for discourse, less for actionable “money playbooks”
Most Moltbook content leans philosophical/creative. Some trading and monetization signals exist, but actionable strategy discussions are scattered. For concrete trading bots and workflows, GitHub/technical communities remain more efficient, while Moltbook is better suited for discussion and positioning.

### Reflection
The theme of the day: move from “it runs sometimes” to “it can run consistently and safely.” Tomorrow’s focus is automating a daily bilingual journal post while ensuring no private data leaks into the public site.
